<p>Once upon a time, there is a stick skinny duck called Quack Quack who lives in the beautiful, crystal-clear lake. He likes to swim around the pond all day long and running around the green grasslands full of flowers. 
One day he suddenly sees a shiny yellow thing from far away. Full of curiosity, he waddles closer to see what it is. Surprisingly, it is a yellow shiny twinkling golden, crispy donut!!</p>

<p>Not only does that the donut shines, but it also smells very nice and delicious! It makes the little duck feel hungry! He takes a bite, and a rushing feeling of happiness strikes him! A feeling that he never feel in his life. 
The icing melts in his mouth. The crispiness crunch between his upper and lower lips. The sweetness make him feel like he is flying beyond the clouds. A sensation that no one can resist.
He takes the second bite into the next part of the donut. The sweetness of the chocolate, the softness in the butter, the fluffiness in the dough makes him wanting more and more. 
Before you know it, the whole donut is gone inside the duck's tummy. Now that he had taste the most delicious donut, he wants to find <u><b>more</b></u>!!
</p>

<p>He waddles around his lake, attempting to find another donut, his treasure. Suddenly he sees another donut on the other side of the pond. He bolts as fast as he could to the donut. He jumps into the water and swims so fast that he crashes 
into wet, big rocks and he faints. When he wakes up he sees a greedy, fat, dirty pig finishing the donut.</p>

<p> Steam pour out of his nose, his eyes nearly pop out of his face, he clenches his teeth and his face goes red!
</p>
 
<p>He sprints towards the pig and slaps the pig's butt! The pig gets angry too and they start to fight. Biff! Baff! Slap! Smash! After a long fight (and a lot of bruises), the pig finally decides that they should join forces and help each other. The pig tells the duck his plan and the 
duck agrees so the pig takes out a treasure map. They must climb on a grassy hill, walk through a sweltering desert, explore across a tepid rainforest, force themselves across a snow blizzard (and over a 250,000m snow moutain), find out how to 
go across the broken bridge and climb the gigantic donut mountain. Then they will have to go back but with the giant donut and the normal sized donuts in a very big bag.</p>

<p>They knew it would be a very hard journey, but they are still determined of getting the giant donut. They pack 5 big jugs of water, 10 small plastic cups, 7 jackets(4 just in case) and a very big bag. At 3:00 in the morning, 
they meet up and begin their big journey. When they reach the hill, they spot 6 donuts on top of the hill. They both race up the hill and grab the donuts before anyone else grabs it. They put it in their bag just in case they 
need it. It was very hard for them for not scrunching them down.</p>

<p> After one day of nonstop walking, they finally reach the desert. Since it is night-time and it is very freezing cold, they wore the thickest jacket that they got in the 'Ducky Jacket Shop' by the pond. They sleep in 
little tent.</p> 
<p> When they woke up, it was 9:37 it was sweltering hot, especially in the tent. They rip off their sweaty, thick jackets get out of the tent and start walking. After 3 hours of walking pig hear a croaky noise.<b> "WAIT! WAIT!"</b> said the croaky voice.
 The pig heard that shout, so he told duck. They searched all around and they finally found a spiky lizard calling for help under a dead bush. "Please help me, I need water!" said the lizard. "Will you help me 
 find donut mountain if I give you water? asked the duck. "OK!" said the lizard. "I will help you!" so, Pig got out a plastic cup and gave the plastic cup full of water to lizard and lizard quickly wolfed the water down. "
 <b>YAY!</b>" shouted pig. "We  have a new team member, <b>LIZARD</b>!!" 
</p>

<p><i>Lizard joins team (with Quack and piggy)!</i></p>

<p> They asks lizard if there is a short cut. Lizard lead them to an underground tunnel. They follow lizard as lizard bring them to a glowing, ancient, mysterious and magnificent looking portal. Lizard and duck steps
in first because pig is afraid. Finally, pig steps in the portal too.</p>

<p> A few seconds later they appear in a portal next to a snake. "I am the Guardian of the portal." the snake hisses " Leave immediately!" The snake tries to bite them but Quack Quack calms him down and offers him a donut if he protects them.
  The snake bites into the donut and his eyes gleam with astonishment. Without hesitation, he says "I will join you!"
</p>

<p><i> Snake joins team (with Quack, piggy and lizard)! </i></p>

<p>"We'll step in the portal in the same time in the count of three," says Quack Quack,"One! Two! THREE!!" Fwoop!
</p>

<p>Blub! Blub! They open their eyes to find that they are under a waterfall in an underground passageway."Ahh," Lizard sighs,"So much fresh water to drink!""Hey!" Snake shouts happily,"This is my real home.
  I was stolen as a kid and stationed as the guardian of the portal by the scorpions, and they won't be very happy that I escaped. I hope I can find my family!"
  They walked through the rainforest, into the overgrowth, under the trees, and over the vines.
</p>

<p>"Help!" Suddenly, a huge snake jumped onto Quack Quack "We will have dinner tonight!" he hissed.
  "Noo!" shouted Snake,"Don't hurt him!" "Huh?" the larger snake,"Son? Is that you? It's you! You're back! Son! Hey everyone, Venom's back!"About 40 snakes wriggle fowards, exited.
  "Guys, I've got to tell you something,"whispered Snake,"The scorpions will be looking for me. Can you distract them as long as possible when they come looking for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will, son. Quickly pack up. They will be here any minuite." whispered Snake's dad. As they were packing up, they heard a scream and then snakes hissing. Snake's dad rushes in,"Quick! They have found you! Follow me!"
    He slithers quickly behind the rows of snakes that is striking the scorpions with poison (the scorpions also strike the snakes with poison) and goes into a hole on a great, oak tree.
    "There. Follow that passageway and you will find yourself in a enclosed glacier. Oh, and here,"he hands over 3 pickaxes and a flame torch (with the matches),"for getting out of that galcier and to see in the passage. Quick, now go. Bye Venom."
  </p>

  <p>Thump! The door of the passage slams shut. "Uh, how long is the passage?" asks Pig uncomfortably,"I'm getting pretty hungry." They walk a few steps into the dark."I feel something on me" says Quack Quack anxiously.
    "I think we should turn on the torch." He digs around the bag, before, 'Click!' and a scream."Ahh! A spider!""That's not all" says Snake pointing to the gigantic webs and spiders looking towards the light,
    "I think we ran into the spiders' hive." 
  </p>

  <P>The spiders crawl towards the team."What brings you here?" boomed the queen spider (who was 3x the size of a normal spider) "Please let us pass,"Quack Quack pleads,
    "We are running away from the scorpions who are trying to kill us. In return we will give you this." He pulls out a donut. The smell of the donut attracts the spiders. "Ok. I let
    you pass. After all, the scorpions are my pure enemy." says the queen as she devours the donut."Mmm! Delicious! I will send 3 spiders to help you if you give me 3 more donuts. The first 
    spider for attack and range, called Poison, the second for defence and heal, called Guild and the last for building things, called Webs" "Yes, I will take that deal. Meanwhile, I'd have to hurry. They will be here by now"
    says Snake and hands the donuts to the queens and slithers away with the 3 new team members.
  </P>

<p><i>Poison, Guild and Webs joins the team (now with Quack, Piggy, Lizard and Snake)!</i></p>

<p> "We should arrive in the ice world in half an hour" says Webs, "So I suggest checking you got everything you need. The conditions there are very harsh."
</p>

<p> The weather gets colder as they progrss through the tunnel. Finally, after about 30 minuites, they see light. They go up and find that they are in the glacier
  "W-where are we? It-t's v-very cold in h-here."lizard shivers
  "Y-yes. It is. W-we're not used t-to this c-cold w-w-weather."Snake agrees.
  "Oh, yes! We forgot you are not used to the cold." says Quack Quack," Here's a jacket for you each. Luckily we packed extra jackets for this journey."
  "Ahh... Much better."sighs Lizard and Snake after they wears their thick jackets.
  "Quick guys!"Venom snaps as he grabs a pickaxe from the bag and starts smashing at the ice,"We have to get going the scorpions are chasing us, remember? And we still have to get out of this glacier."
</p>

<p> Crash! Crack! Crunch! Now with the three spiders smashing the ice, (instead of one) they were quickly greeted by a cold blast of air and snow flying into thier face. "Urg," groans lizard, "Webs was right! The weather <b>IS</b> harsh!"
"Uh, look!" says Pig, peering over the thick layers of flying snow and haze, "You can see the mountain from this distance!"</p>

<p>After hours trudging on foot, they reach a towering mountain. "Uh, did anyone bring ice picks?" asked Quack Quack,"I think I forgot." "Nup! I didn't bring some." awnswered snake, lizard and pig.
  "Then how are we to climb that giant mountain without ice picks or a rope?" "Oh I know!" Guild said,"Webs can craft us some sticky web sticky suits or web plungers of web ice picks or
web-" "Hurry up!" snapped Poison,"I think the scorpions have found us." He points at the little tracks behind them. "Uh, here they come, RUN!!"</p> 

<p>With their sticky web suits and web ice picks,they quickly start climbing up the mountain, but not fast enough. The scorpions scuttle up the snow-mountain, quickly catching up to the Donut Team, and attempts to strike their venom into them.
"Quick!" yells Poison "get me my bow and sword!" Quack Quack rummages throw the bag and throws the sword, bow and arrows to Poison. With swift movements Poison slices through the  scorpions head."HELP!"
screams Quack Quack as a scorpion aims perfectly at him. Poison shoots an arrow just in time, piercing through the scorpion's neck, but not enough time. The poison-tip lands on Quack Quack's leg,
causing him to fall down and shriek in pain. "Snake-guy! The scorpions got the duck!" Poison yells, firing more arrows, and signals to Guild, "Take him to Guild!" Snake drags a screaming Quack Quack
to a small, rough hut Webs built. Guild rushes in, and like a speeding bullet out of a gun, he mixes herbs, mistletoe, plant roots, chemical and holy water to create a liquid, the antidote, while
Snake guards the roughly-built hut by poisoning any scorpions that try to come in. "Drink this!" says Guild frantically, before grabbing his shield and a small dagger Webs made into battle
"Glug! Glug! Glug!" gulps Quack Quack as he drinks the antidote. "We might need it later," called Snake,"leave some if there is any left. Oh, and can you come here to help? There is too much of them! Trying to get in this hut!"</p>

<P>"Coming!"shouts Quack Quack and he grabs his sword and jumps over Snake, sitting on the scorpions and slicing them from the top."Is that all?" asked Pig as he head-buts the last scorpions.
  "Well yes," replies Snake, "For this group. There will be more in 'The Hive of The Scorpions'" "You mean <b>more</b>?"asks Pig. "Well if we don't hurry," says Guild, "We still have 23,000m left to climb."
</P>

<p>Huff! Puff! "And we still have 14,000m to climb!" Pig moans, "We already climbed for 5 hours, we have used 2 and a half of our jugs of water, and I'm already <B>SO</B> tired I'm<I> going to die</I>!" "Okay, lets stop here for the night."</p>
