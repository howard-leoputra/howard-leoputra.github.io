            <h2>Prologue</h2>
            <p>
            Dad got a new job so we are moving houses. Everything is falling apart.
            I had to say my last farewells to my best friend Tom, all my other friends and my old town, the one that I truly belong.
            Before long, I was glancing back at my old house, thinking if this would be the last time, I would see it.
            I would have to make new friends, new connections, and get used it.
            I mean, it is all not that bad, until I found out the horrors of this cursed house.
            </p>
            <br>

 	<h2>Chapter 1 - The New House</h2>
<p>
Heat shimmered in the summer air as if it was radioactive. 
There were no clouds in the sky and the smell of bushfires and smoke, and fire lingered in the air. 
"Are we almost there yet?" my sister Beth and I complained for about the hundredth and twentieth time.
It probably was not about how long we were driving for, but about the fact that if we stayed in the car a minute longer, we will probably get roasted and baked crisp. 
"We're almost there," Mum nagged, and it was true. 
Soon, the car screeched to a stop and parked at the front of a ramshackle house.
It had a cold feeling, despite the summer heat. 
The lawn had large patches in it with a fishy, weird smell to it and the grass was yellowing in large quantities of tall grass, withering flowers, and weeds, varying from tall to short, and big too small. 
I scanned my surroundings. 
Wildflowers in colours of yellow, purple, red swayed along with the daisies and the blue forget-me-nots, which were as piercing as the summer sky, in the warm afternoon breeze. A hint of smoke floated through the air. 
The sign, which wrote: '<b>FOR SALE</b>' was now hastily stamped with a sticker that read: '<b>SOLD</b>.' The sign was hanging on one edge, and when I tried to fix it, the whole thing fell down and landed in a patch of sand, underneath a withered, blackened tree. 
A half-burnt leaf, crispy from the hot weather danced in the warm breeze for a few seconds before plummeting to the ground at my feet.
Even the bricks of the mailbox were crumbling in ruins.
"Do you like our new house? The price was surprisingly reasonable too." asked Mum cheerfully.
I forced a smile and looked up.
"Well, I guess," I mumbled. 
In reality, I thought this house looked like a run-down decaying building with the crooked foundations, dark purple and cherry wood, an unbelievably bad colour for a house. 
I guess, the only good thing was that it had two stories, and I always wanted to live in a tall house.
"Where is dad?" I asked.
"Dad said he was just going to check the house and then he had to go to the airport and fly to another country. I am sure it is an important thing for new job. It is probably a welcome meeting or something. He will be back in a few days." assured Mum as she closed the driver door with a nudge as she carried a pile of food, bags, and other essentials. 
"Oscar, help me get the bags and Beth will get the luggage." Mum pressed a button on the car keys, and it chirped as Mum lifted the boot of the white sedan open. I carried the bags to the grimy stone steps as Mum fished out the keys. 
The bronze handle was had a dark stain of red to it, and it felt greasy. Mum unlocked the doors, and we went inside. 
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 - The Crime Scene</h2>

<p>
Inside was not any better, in fact it might have been worse.
 The first thing that hit me was the smell. The air smelled like mildew and dust. 
The carpets made a tearing with every step I took, and there were cracks in the ceiling. I tried to turn on the light, and the dust on it exploded, and it shone brightly for two seconds, but it weakly flickered and then turned off. 
The yellow and green wallpaper was peeling off, showing off the rough, dark spruce wood underneath. 
At this point, I did not think this was classified as a decent house anymore. It was like a shelter that had been abandoned for a decade, and it was falling apart. 
I went up the uneven staircase that groaned with every step I took.
"Definitely having this room!" Beth yelled as she threw down the luggage and occupying the room, the one that I was thinking to have for myself. 
"Fine," I grumbled. Being the younger sibling, I always had to take the second choice. I went to the other room, which was not as good as the other one, and flopped down on the chair. 
I put my bag down and left Mum's bags in the master bedroom.
I guessed this scene was not bad. I had a whole view of the neighbourhood. 
The blood orange light filled the room from the window. 
It was like watching the view of a sunset on a mountain. This was probably the best thing from the house so far, maybe the only good thing about this. 
I was glad to have taken this room instead of Beth's room (though I still think that Beth's room looked cleaner and less old and crusty without the peeling wallpaper).
"BETH! OSCAR!" Mum's voice called out, "We're not done yet! Come and help me get the TV!" 
I had one last glance of the neighbourhood where people were playing basketball and others were running around and having walks. 
The whole scene looked breath-taking. Just as I was about to leave the room, a flash of yellow and black caught my eye. 
I turned around. Lying on the floor, was a piece of plastic tape, reflecting the fading sunlight into my eyes. It had the words 'POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS.' I observed it carefully. 'Why would a crime scene tape be here? Something must have happened, something not good.'
Before I could observe the tape any longer, Mum called out to me.
"OSCAR!" Mum shouted, "Come down now!"
I left the tape on my misshapen desk and left the room.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 - The Oil Painting</h2>
<p>
My heart was still pounding in my chest as I walked down the creaky steps. 
I rubbed my sweaty palms on my shirt. 
I still couldn't take my mind of what I had just seen. 
I hopped off the last step and landed with a crunch on the floor.
I quickly helped Beth carry the television, careful not to leave fingerprints on the screen. 
We placed the television on a low console table and plugged the wires in the electrical cord. The cord made electrical sparks, making me and Beth jump back.
"Let's see if it works." I told Beth.
"Yeah Oscar," she replied, "Hope it isn't broken."
I clicked the remote. Click. The television flickered to life as if it was waking up from a good nap but as I flicked through the different channels, it was all static. 
The only thing was that was on the black screen was glitches of grey and white. I was so desperate that I even flicked to the local news channel.
The television crackled, "Reporting-"- Static- "- we have been warned-" - more static - "-avoid at all costs-" - even more static- "-the paint- "the most static of all of the pauses, and then even the news was now just a screen of glitches and crackling.
"Oops," Beth winced, "I think we're not going to be watching TV for a long time."
"How do you turn this thing off?" I clicked the 'POWER' button in frustration. Click, click, click.
Click. Click. Click. Click. I turned around, who was clicking?
"Stop clicking," complained Beth.
"It is not me!" I shouted back, feeling accused. Click, click.
"Then who is?" taunted Beth.
I strained my ears. The clicking sound had stopped.
"Probably nothing" I replied and went up the stairs to my bed.
Halfway in the hallway to my room, I noticed a priceless oil painting. 
Candles that were lit made an ominous dark glow to it.
'That was weird' I thought. Nobody had lit it up.
It looked very old, with the features cracking and the paint yellowing. 
The weird thing was that only the frame was coated in dust, but the painting itself was dust-less, like someone had just touched it recently. 
The owners had left it behind, probably knowing that this costed thousands of dollars. It had a girl in a robe smiling coldly at me. 
She had a navy-blue robe, and I had a feeling that it was not just sheep wool, but probably something magical, and the painter had painted it to make it look like it was glowing. She had gorgeous orange eyes, and dark hair. It looked like she was in a cafe that was closed, with most of the lights turned off and some empty chairs and tables was lightly painted with dark brown, maybe even tan.  
In the far-left corner, near the bar stand, there was a man and another figure cowering. I couldn't make out the face of the man because of the darkness, but in my subconsciousness, my gut told me I knew him.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 4 - Thinking</h2>
<p>
	It was just 7 and Mum hasn't cooked dinner yet, but I was just as weary, so I went to bed. I changed the dusty old sheets that the previous owners did not change, with new ones from the luggage.
 It was weird. I mean this house, everything. All the things in this house seemed to be left in a hurry, and everything seemed to be breaking apart.
I gazed out the window. The evening sky was streaked in colours of purple and dark blue, as the sun prepared to say goodnight. I took a deep breath.
 I knew moving into a new house was always scary, but this was different. 
What was with all the weird things, like the crime tape, and the creepy painting of the girl, and with everything left in a hurry. I had discovered a stack of money in one of the drawers of my table, counting about 520 dollars. 
I also found a golden watch in one of the other drawers, like one of those very expensive ones. The detail of the gold glinted in the dying sunlight, and it as absorbed into the diamond cover, making the watch brighter for a few seconds. 
I mean, who would forget 520 dollars in their drawers along with a $10,000 or so watch. And also, why would a person who owns a $10,000 watch has not enough money to fix their crumbling house, or at least the walls? 
Inside, the closet I found clothes left there. 
I took another few deep breaths, then took out a pencil and piece of paper. Drawing always helped me calm myself down, so I drew the evening scene.
'Everything is alright' I told myself, 'It is just some normal thing, nothing is wrong.'
I gazed out into the dying light, and sighed, 'Think about normal things, like what will the new school be, or maybe about what baseball cards to collect, anything but thinking about this weird home'.
I stayed there until the last fraction of the sun finally dipped under the horizon, and the dark midnight-blue sky finally turned obsidian black, as the moon waved hello. 
I sketched out the road and the pavements and the details of the neighbour's gnarled oak tree. I drew the last few details until it was too dark to see anything else.
I held it out. Not bad, but not the best one I drawn.
 It probably would have looked better if the desk was not so wobbly and crooked, or maybe if I used a HB pencil instead of 3B one, because it looked a little too dark with the features too outlined, but it looked fine. 
I was usually good with sceneries and houses or even objects, but with humans and animals and plants, not so much. 
I always get the proportions wrong or the shading too light or hard. 
Finally, my eyes felt heavy, so I set my drawing down and lied on my bed, but it was long after before I actually fell asleep.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 5 - Nightmares</h2>
<p>
	That night, I dreamed about a girl. She had a purple dark robe, the bottom of it dragging on the cold stone floor. Her eyes were as cold as ice.
She had orange pupils, and tan hair, the colour of dark chocolate. 
In the dream, I was pleading, begging for mercy. 
Three other figures appeared from the dark room, only lit up by dim spotlights. 
The three figures also had the dark-obsidian robes. One of them looked at me with pity. They put their hands up and started chanting words in a language I did not know. 
A red symbol which looked like a rectangle with a figure inside appeared beneath me. It glowed in the darkness, illuminating the room.
The girl took out a golden dagger out of her belt and advanced towards me.
Its golden features glinted in the light of the symbol beneath my feet. A face of a lion snarled on it, as if it had just found a zebra after it had been starving for days.
"No, please NO!" I begged, "NO! You don't deserve it!"
She did not answer me, she just approached me her sunset eyes full of maliciousness, but there was a hint of victory in there. The girl smiled cruelly and touched me gently with the tip of the dagger in my forehead and a drop of blood welled out. Searing pain burst out on my forehead, like I had been burnt by a hot rod of metal that just came out from foundry. I crumpled and the ground hard. 
It fell into the ground making the room shake as it burst into flames. 
My screams echoed away as I jerked up from my bed in cold sweat. 
It felt deafening in the silence from the screams in my dream. 
I touched my forehead, and I felt a mark where the girl had touched me with her knife. 
My forehead still stung with dull throbbing pain.
The girl looked, well, familiar, like I just seen her yesterday.
'How is this possible?' I thought, 'It was just a dream.'
I steadied my rapid, sharp breathing and tried to calm myself down. 
Shakily, I got to my feet and walked to my mirror. There was a faint scar on my forehead. I looked around. I remembered I was in my new house. 
The faint smell of the dust still lingered around. 
I looked at the clock. 10:00 in the morning?! 
Then, I realised there was no batteries. 
I searched the dusty, cobwebbed wardrobe for batteries. 
I shrieked and bit my lip from screaming so loud, that it wakes up everyone in the neighbourhood, as a tarantula as big as my hand leaped towards me.
I threw to it to the ground and squished as hard as I can with my night slippers.
It was messy, but it was better than getting stung.
I shuddered in disgust and looked back in the cupboard. 
There was a box of batteries, but it was too high for me, and I wouldn't want to risk seeing the tarantula's dear sweet children, so I just opened the curtains and gazed out into the early sky. 
The sky was still dark, but the sun was slowly rising over the peak of houses in the neighbourhood. 
A woman was walking her dog and I figured it was our next-door neighbour. 
The colours of purple, orange and yellow slowly streaked the sky. Birds were squawking and flying about, in the sky. 
I figured it was only 6 in the morning, but I closed the door and went outside anyways.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 - Photos</h2>

<p>
I walked down the hallway, to the direction of the stairs, yawning and rubbing my eyes. 
Just as I passed the oil painting, I saw a flash of movement. 
I darted around. There was no one there.
'Must be Beth sneaking up on me,' I thought, 'She is always trying to play tricks on me.' I slowly opened the door of Beth's room and shouted 'BOO!' I looked around. Beth was still fast asleep in her bed, snoring away. I felt my cheeks go red as I quietly close her door.
'Then who was it?' I thought.
I looked suspiciously around one more time and walked down the stairs. 
When I got down the creaking stairs, I saw that mum was already up. She was listening to an early '20 Quick Fashion Tips to Improve Your Beauty' show. It was weird because it was not working before.
'Probably just the weather,' I thought.
"-put on some lipstick, before- "the television said.
I found her wearing her morning gown and her rich brown hair like a dog's breakfast. When she saw me, she quickly turned off the television. 
She quickly ruffled her hair in an unsuccessful attempt to put it in place. 
"Well," she said, holding her hands up, "you're up already! You better get ready for school because this would be your first day!"
"Well okay," I murmured as I walked to the cupboard and opened it. 
I took the cereal out and set it on the table. As I looked for a bowl, I found pictures of the old owners in the top row. The people were 2 elderly couples, from the most recent picture. It showed them holding the priceless oil painting I saw earlier, in an auction. The next looked like they were a few years younger, maybe 5 or 6 years before, showing them when they first bought the house. 
In the photo, the lawn was green and cropped, and the house was nothing from old and crooked. 
It was painted foam green, a light shade of green, and the windows were neatly scrubbed and polished. 
The weirdest thing was that the foundations were still straight and just like a house should be. 
'What could have caused the foundations to bend so much, and what happened to this house?' I wondered, 'What made them leave their home, and if so, why did they leave everything they owned behind? Maybe they did not leave their home on their choice. It might have been a freak accident or something that left this house in this current state."
I was left deep in thought that by the time I snapped out of it, it was already 7 in the morning. 
Mum had already gone back in her room, and the sun was shining brightly in the dull and stained windows. Just as I grabbed the bowl, headed for the fridge to get the milk, I heard creaking noises from the stairs. A big shadow was illuminated by the lights from the hallway on the second floor. Was it the ghosts of the old owners? 
I saw the shadow advancing down the stairs. 
I cautiously took a step back. Creak, creak... the stairs groaned. 
I tried to back off carefully, yet the shadow advanced. I did the only thing I knew, scream.
</p>


<h2>Chapter 7 - Accidental Sighting</h2>

<p>
"AHH, HELP! AHH!" I screamed in the top of my lungs. Then, I realised standing in front of me was my sister.
"What?" she asked, confused. Her freckles glistened in the sun, and her blue eyes were scrunched up like when she does when she is confused.
"Oh, you startled me," I muttered sheepishly. I felt my face hot as Beth raised an eyebrow.
"Well, okay..." she said, definitely unconvinced.
Her beautiful blonde hair was tied into a ponytail, with a red ribbon. She already looked ready for school. 
She already worn her new school uniform, with her skirt with patterns of blue and green. Her white dress-shirt was tucked neatly in her Carolina-blue suit, finally matched with a tie.
"Wow, you look organised." I muttered, as she took the bowl out of my hands and poured herself a bowl of cereal.
"Yeah, you do not." she chided. I looked down at myself. I still had my pyjamas on and my night slippers. Then, I looked at the time, it was 7:30 already.
'Oh no,' I thought, 'I will be late for school.' 
I ran up the stairs, almost tripping on the last step, and darted to my room. I shook off my slippers, threw off my clothes, revealing my bony body, and quickly put on my dress suit, threw on some jeans, fastened my tie, and quickly flattened out my navy-blue suit. I looked around for some socks before heading back down. I glanced at the painting. 
It looked like it was... moving? I watched in horror as I saw the girl pull out a dagger. It was the same golden dagger I saw in my dream. 
I realised the girl I saw in my dream was her. I knew I shouldn't be looking at this stuff, but I stayed anyways. 
Paralysed in fear, I watched the girl touch a woman with a business suit with the dagger, and the woman crumpled to the ground. The other three people from the summoning ritual appeared from the mist and started chanting. 
Just as the symbol under the woman's feet started glowing, the girl in the hood turned around, as her orange eyes widened. She dropped her dagger and as it clattered to the floor of the painting, the whole painting shook, and when I opened my eyes, the girl was just standing there, just as she always was, smiling coldly at me. 
This time when I looked in the corner of the painting, there were only 1 person left. One of them had disappeared.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 - Road to Hell</h2>

<p>
"I must be hallucinating," I muttered to myself on the school bus.
"What?" Beth asked me. She was sitting next to me. She applied some lipstick to her lips, making them cherry red. 
To me, I thought it her lips were too red, and her eyelashes too dark from her eyeliner, but to everyone else, Beth looked gorgeous.
"Oh nothing," I murmured to Beth, trying to keep my voice down, "I know that you won't believe this, but I will tell you anyways."
"Yeah," she nodded, unzipping her bag, and putting in her makeup things in.
"You know the painting of that creepy girl in our house, right?" I started.
"Yeah, and she's not creepy." Beth commented.
"Anyways, I saw, a murder scene, and I saw the girl from the painting kill someone."
Beth sounded unconvinced, "Yes, I know you have a great imagination of things, but when it comes to serious times you can't talk about this stuff."
"But- "I started,
"Yeah, yeah. I know," Beth cut in, "Trying to scare me, right?"
"No- "I tried again, but this time, the bus stopped at the new school.
"Time to get off now." Beth stood up. She ruffled her skirt before walking out of the bus. Just as I stood up, I saw a note underneath my seat. It was written in dark red paint. It wrote:
 'I know that you saw me take someone's soul. I will tell you that I did. Just know I am watching you, and if you tell anyone, you're next.
	 Alexandra '
"Quick!" called Beth, but her voice seemed millions of miles away. My breathing turned into big heavy sighs. I couldn't believe it. What I saw was real. The girl had a name.
Beth had come back on the bus and was shaking my shoulder, "Oscar, what is wrong with you? Quick come on!"
I quickly crumpled the note and slipped it into my pocket. I followed her off the bus.
"Sorry," Beth apologetically told the bus driver, then glared at me. "What took you so long?" Beth then realised she was making a scene in front of all the kids and let go of me. Then, I looked up at the school in front of us. 
It was also awful, one of the worst schools I have seen.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 - School of Hell</h2>
<p>
"Great," I sighed, "Looks worse than our house."
The bricks of the classes were black with grime. Occasionally, one of the classrooms won't have a working air conditioner. 
The fences had big holes in it, wide enough to crawl in and out. There were also pieces of bricks lying on the dirt of massive holes, the size of a classroom, and there were lots of them. We did have a small oval, but the grass was dead and smelled fishy and weird, just like the one in our new house. 
In the middle of the classrooms and massive holes, was a courtyard, with a big warped dead oak tree in the middle. Worse of all there were only 6 classrooms, one classroom for arts, music, sports, and all of that altogether, which means we will be squished in together. I sighed. 
This would be a long year. When I thought nothing would get worse, a teacher came, "Hello, we're having a blast, welcome to the school. Hello." The teacher's eyes seemed to be glassy, and she seemed to be in a trance. 
I looked horrified as she shook everyone's hand, and not get impatient. I felt an electric spark as I, myself shook her hand. Reluctantly, I trudged in this awful school. When I got to my first class, there were thirty-eight students packed like sardines in the class. Even though I tried to object, the teacher insisted to shake everyone's hand. 
All the desks were crooked, except the teachers' desk and we had to 'share' seats, so we were totally squished with three people in one bench. 
Now I was getting scared. In math, we learnt our five times tables and easy additions. What is this school? We learnt this stuff like three years ago in Year 2. 
The next lesson was English. This was even worse. 
We had to spell words like 'bird,' or 'art' or even 'cat' and 'dog'. 
Then in art, it was a giant leap. 
We had to draw a realistic picture of a man then shade it in with charcoal. Now this was getting weird. 
And sure, it was very noisy because another class of 36 people were playing music. 
And someone would mess up their artwork every 30 seconds and the teacher would have a replacement of thick paper and a gold tinted metal frame. 
Then in the school assembly (which was no more than a table under a tree) came, and it confirmed my worst fears.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 - Badly Drawn Portrait</h2>
<p>
	I stared at it. It was a charcoal sketch, that the details were too dark, it looked like just a big blob of black. 
Even with the bad details I could still kind of make out what it was. It was one of the 3 assistants of Alexandra, the girl in the painting. 
I remembered from the painting and my dream. 
Then the painting flickered, and it turned into a middle-aged man wearing a suit. The teachers told me in the same dull voices that his name was Mr Luke. 
Then the teachers listened patiently to the man, not moving, all of them, just standing and waiting patiently as he was announcing a 'welcome' speech. The man, or 'Mr Luke,' said that this was the best school in the city. 
'Or maybe it was, until what looked like a natural disaster happened here.'
 Then occasionally, the man would flicker, I mean literally flicker, and show the charcoal painting. I looked up and groaned. Was I going crazy? I reluctantly listened, occasionally hearing whispers, then it will stop. 
(I knew that the reason why they stopped was because of the zaps this crazy man, or painting radiates whenever someone started talking, I could tell you, it hurts).
"What kind of school is this?" I whispered to Beth, who was behind me.
"Shh!" Beth hissed back, "Something must be wrong."
"Yeah, I know. I -OW!" I winced as I got zapped with the red energy. 
I quickly turned around again. "Tell you at home." I whispered. Then I went silent. I did not want to be zapped again. As I was sitting doing nothing, I thought about how much I wanted to go home, I mean, our old home. I sighed. As much as I wanted to go, I know that I wanted to dig deeper into this situation and find out what is happening. What was up with this weird town, and the houses. 
I mean, not the whole town is weird, but I had a feeling the buildings with the paintings, or flickering people. It was like they were radiating some destructive energy that made buildings crumble and deteriorate. I know how the school used to look like. In art, there was a photo that had won first place for photography. 
It was labelled, "Our School". In the photo, the fences were straight, the classrooms were brightly polished, and there were 24 classes. The massive holes I had seen earlier were classes, but it had just disappeared. Finally, after a few more minutes of the boring speech, the teachers dismissed us and told us to go home. They said in harmony, "Thank you for coming to the school. We hope you had a fun and awesome day. I had a blast. Bye, Bye." I looked around for the weird principal, but he had already gone.
"How could a person walk so fast?" I thought.
Just outside the school, I told Beth to wait for me as I checked my bag to make sure I had brought everything. 
Just as I got to the very bottom of my bag, my hand felt a crumpled note, written in charcoal this time. 
It was smudged a little, but it was still readable. 
It darkly sketched, 'You told your sister a hint, Oscar, but I am not as cruel as Alexandra, and I believe you should have a chance. Try not to mention this again. I might not be able to help you again.
	Luke'
</p>

<h2>Chapter 11 - Fear of Paintings</h2>

<p>
From that on, I tried to avoid going up the stairs and passing Alexandra. 
I just lingered on the ground floor while eating snacks and watching some random local cartoons show on the television to pass the time. 
Finally, I got the courage to go up there and say hello. 
I gulped as I stood in front of the painting and whimpered, "Hello." The painting did not respond.
"Hello?" I tried again. Still again, no response. The painting just stood there smiling coldly at me, just like it always had.
"Alexandra?" I called. I thought I saw her lips move, but then Beth came out of her room, still wearing her uniform, but she had taken her suit and tie off. 
She also took of her ribbon, making her long blonde hair sweep all over her face. She brushed her hair aside and looked at me like I was from Mars.
"What do you think you are doing?" she asked with an annoyed expression, "Are you trying to talk to the painting? Are you just trying to pull my leg?"
I wanted to tell Beth the truth about the notes of the paintings and the visions of the paintings changing, but I remembered what Alexandra had said. 
Then I thought about Luke's warning. 
"No," I said, shaking my head vigorously, "Definitely not."
"Sounds like you are," she argued back. She was definitely not in the mood. She glared at me like I was doing something wrong, "Are you going crazy?"
I sighed, "Look, just mind your own business and go back in your room. And I am all fine, and I am not insane."
"Fine," she grumbled, undoing a button on her dress shirt, then going back to her room, and slamming the door behind her. 
Then I heard the shower turn on as I heard water crashing on the inside. I wanted to argue with her more, but I guess now was not a good idea. I probably had at least a few minutes to question the painting.
"Alexandra! Are you in there, or are you just a lie?" I shouted at the painting, running out of patience. I was starting to get annoyed. 
Just as I decided this whole thing was fake, I heard a voice that scared the daylights out of me.
"I suppose I owe you one." a female voice said. My worst fears had been confirmed. 
I spun around, but the girl, or as you say Alexandra, was just standing there, smiling. Maybe Beth was the one pulling my leg, but at that time, I was too scared to think. 
I sprinted down and leaped of the stairs. I crashed hard on my stomach, but I ignored the pain. I ran to the front door and tried to jerk the door open, but I almost pulled my fingers out of my sockets. Just as I looked for the key, I stopped myself. 
I tried to steady my breathing, as I rubbed my sweaty palms on my suit with stains of grease and dirt. I slumped down to the floor and took of my suit, along with jerking my tie off. I rubbed my sore stomach. Maybe Beth was right. I was going crazy. 
At any rate, she would prove herself enjoy her 'I told you so,' moment as I was going insane, because at this point, I thought I was turning into a psychopath. I found myself looking up to see Beth staring at me. 
Her long hair was dripping wet, and a towel was wrapped around her body.
"Sorry, but I really think you are going crazy now." She murmured, "Are you OK? I heard you scream so I came down."
"It - it was the painting," I whimpered, then remembering what Alexandra and Luke had told me, and then muttered, "It is nothing."
"Are you seriously afraid of paintings?" she asked curiously.
I did not answer. I was not afraid of a stupid piece of art. 
I was afraid of the girl in the painting. I was afraid of Alexandra.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 12 - Alone Again</h2>

<p>
	"Maybe you're right." I screamed at Beth, "I am going crazy."
Beth looked at me dumfounded, "I - I am sorry of what I said. I did not mean it."
"WHATEVER!" I shrieked, "Leave me alone before I turn into a lunatic and start attacking you!"
"I will get mum and then get changed," Beth murmured and hurried back upstairs. 
I tried to calm myself down, but I couldn't. I just couldn't. 
I was sweating like crazy. My brain just couldn't comprehend it. 
It had probably been more than five minutes already, so I went up the stairs. 
From the door, I heard glimpses of Beth and Mum's conversation. 
"-think he's going crazy."
"-talk to him later - "
I slowly opened the door. "Hello?"
"Honey," Mum said, "Are you okay? Beth said that you were very upset."
"Well, yeah I guess so." I mumbled, not meeting her eyes.
"I know what it feels like." Said Mum, in a soft voice, "Moving houses are scary, but soon, everything would be back to normal."
"Yeah," muttered Beth understandably, then left the room.
"It is not just that," I thought. 
I did not hear what Mum said next because I was so deep in thought.
"- Is it okay?" Mum asked.
"Yeah, okay." I nodded.
I left the room, and Mum closed her door. I stared at the painting. 
The girl's blue robe seemed to be glinting more than before. Her smile looked more mischievous, and her in the back of her eyes, I saw purple flames in them, the symbol of her power. 
I stood there staring at the painting. I was alone again.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 13 - The Darkened Canvas</h2>

<p>
Alexandra suddenly moved. I jumped back, and almost screamed, but I held it back as best as I could by biting my lip so hard it started bleeding.
"Y-you're real" I stammered. 
"Yes, I am," Alexandra's voice echoed in my skull.
I gulped and stared at the painting in disbelief. 
The girl seemed to be talking in my mind. I took out the crumpled note from my pocket.
I let it slip out of my hand and plummet to the floor.
"Yes, I was the one that wrote it."
Alexandra walked to one of the figures cowering in fear in the corner and dragged him to closer to the frame. I looked in horror as I saw who it was. 
I knew it. I already had a bad feeling of this painting, and this had just confirmed my worst fears. 
The man was bald, and one of his lenses of his glasses were cracked. His tie was greasy and the suit he always wore to work was missing, the only thing he was wearing now, was his slightly ripped vest and underneath was his white dress shirt, now splattered with sweat and blood. 
He had a gash on his floppy cheeks, and he was screaming in mercy.
"Dad?" My voice wavered as I stepped forward.
"N-no, don't. Don't step any closer. She will take you." My dad quavered.
"Come and save your dad," Alexandra taunted. She took the golden dagger I'd seen take the businesswoman's life.
The golden head of the miniature lion on it bared its fangs and roared.
She drew the dagger closer to my dad's head.
"NO!" I screamed.
'What is this?' I asked myself, 'It can't be real' My heart was thumping as I watched in horror. 
I felt dizzy.
I felt like I just got punched in the gut.
"You can save him. I just need someone for exchange."
"No... Don't..." My dad managed. He shook his head.
"Why are you doing this?" I gasped with cold sweat trickling down my neck, "I don't understand."
"Oh, you will," the girl in the painting said, and she snapped her fingers.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 14 - The Truth</h2>
<p>
The scene of the painting changed, and the girl and my dad disappeared. 
I couldn't move, I was paralysed in fear. 
The paint just mixed together, in somehow a delightful way, without turning brown or grey or a dull colour.
When the painting refocused, it showed a young girl wearing a dress holding pink flowers. She had orange eyes, and dark hair. 
I realised I was looking at Alexandra when she was young. 
The scene of the painting was set in an old cottage.
Somehow, the sounds just projected into my mind.
I heard cows mooing in the distance.
"Mama?" Young Alexandra called.
She wandered into the small kitchen, clutching her beautiful pink tulips.
The kitchen was no bigger than a fireplace and a small wooden table.
Grime stained the bricks of the walls and the floor.
I heard faint shouting and yelling, not in fear, but in anger. 
Little Alexandra gasped in horror. Alexandra's mum had blue eyes, but the same dark hair. 
A man with a shaggy singed beard was looming over her, holding a flintlock pistol. He wore the clothes of a man from the early 19th century, the time of the industrial revolution. 
He wore a waistcoat with a rolled shawl, which looked extremely tight through the waist. He had long cargo jeans which were greased in oil, probably from working in the factory. The man was threatening Alexandra's mum, with his saliva spitting everywhere. 
"Hand over the money!" he screamed. He pushed the gun deeper into Alexandra's mum's head.
"B-but I don't have anymore!" stammered Alexandra's mum, "I had given you all I had!"
"NOW!" Screamed the man. His eyes were wild with hunger as he started to push his finger towards the trigger.
Little Alexandra screamed and started punching the man, "Stop! Stop!" she wailed.
The man turned to Alexandra and pointed the gun at her.
Bang! Bang! 
The two shots narrowly missed Little Alexandra, planting holes into the bricks behind her. Little Alexandra's eyes were wild terror, but I could see a hint of anger in it.
"NO!" shouted Alexandra's mum as she started pulling at the man's clothes, but the man shook her off ignored her. 
He advanced towards Little Alexandra. "I have four shots left, surely one will hit you." The man growled.
Suddenly, Alexandra leaped onto the man, as fast as a rocket, and snatched the flintlock pistol off him. "Stop hurting my mother!" Little Alexandra shouted fiercely.
In an attempt to get his gun back, the man jumped towards Little Alexandra.
Then, I saw what was coming. 
Alexandra fired the pistol. 
The man jumped out of the way just in time with the bullets searing his jacket, and the shells clattered onto the floor. The paint in the painting mixed again and showed Little Alexandra screaming as her mother crumpled to the floor in a heap of blood.
"You've killed your own mother." A male voice said. Little Alexandra turned around, still sobbing, "You will need to pay. Even though it was not your fault, you decided to fire that gun." Said a man with a long scruffy beard, and he was wearing a white toga, "I am the god of justice. And to make it right, you will live in this for eternity"
A painting frame appeared out of the air, and Alexandra shrieked as she got sucked into the painting, and then the whole scene exploded.
When the painting came back into focus, I saw Alexandra, the big Alexandra, and she said, "Until I learnt that I needed to take five souls. Then I can escape this burden. I've already took two, the first one was the one of the people from the auction. The second was the old man who lived here, shortly followed by his wife. Then after that was the businesswoman you saw. Then, it's him." She gestured at Dad.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 15 - Fearless</h2>

<p>
"So, what's your answer?" Alexandra asked. I looked at the figures cowering in the corner. I looked at Dad.
"This." I spoke. I leaped towards the painting with all my might.
"NO!" Dad screamed. Instead of smashing my brains out, I kept falling I finally landed onto a hard wooden floor. I winced as I plucked a splinter out of my finger. A drop of blood dripped out. I quickly wiped it on my shirt and stood up.
"Ha, ha. This?" Alexandra smirked. She pulled out her dagger.
"You want to fight? Let's fight." I glared at Alexandra and stood up, trying not to quiver in fright as best as I can.
"No, don't" Dad mumbled. He tried to pull Alexandra away from me, but she kicked Dad back onto the ground and glared at him.
I put my hands in my pocket to see if I had anything to fight with. 
I felt something and pulled it out.
A sharpened pencil. That should be better than nothing.
"You think you can defeat me with a pencil after my 200 years of existence? Good luck on doing that." Alexandra mock laughed.
She raised up her hands and out from a dark veil of mist, her three companions appeared. Luke looked at me sadly. The other two were a water-colour figure and a pen sketch.
"I think the boy should deserve a chance." Luke mumbled.
"What?!" snapped Alexandra and glared at him.
"No, no nothing." He whispered and looked at me, with pity in his eyes.
I glared at Alexandra, "Are you too cowardly that you are just going to hide behind your companions?"
Anger flared in Alexandra's orange eyes, making a shade of purple in them.
"Get him." She growled.
I saw Alexandra's companions raise their hands. 
Luke reluctantly raised his. They started chanting what I recognised from my dream.
 A symbol appeared underneath my feet. With wrath in her eyes, she held up her dagger and started advancing towards me. 
With my instinct, kicked her and stabbed the pencil in her arm.
She removed the pencil from her arm and threw it away.
Blood, golden blood started dripping from her arm.
The symbol was getting brighter now. Alexandra kicked me to the ground and raised the dagger over my head.
"NO!" Dad screamed.
I braced myself, but after 3 seconds nothing happened.
I opened my eyes to see Luke standing in front of me. Holding a silver dagger himself, which had Alexandra's golden blood dripping from it. "Luke?" I managed.
Alexandra stood up. "You traitor," she spat at Luke.
Two dozen of smoky figures appeared. They all were wearing the black robes, and all had a golden dagger that were shining in the darkness.
Luke, Dad, and me all huddled to the centre. Luke threw his dagger at one of the figures and it collapsed into dark mist and a pile of robes, but we knew it was hopeless. It was us three, undefended, versus Alexandra, her two evil assistances, and 23 other smoky figures.
They would overpower us in a matter of seconds.
It would be the end.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 16 - Revealed</h2>

<p>
	Suddenly all the figures froze. They all looked up. Outside the painting, I saw Beth staring at the painting in disbelief, horror, and fear. 
"Dad? Oscar?" she gasped. She nodded, as if she now understands how I feel.
Beth picks up one of the candles.
"No, you don't" Alexandra shakes her head. Her eyes are wild and full of fear. It was the same expression when she shot and killed her own mother. "You will kill everyone."
Beth hesitates.
I nod to her, telling Beth that I am ready. She plunges the flaming candle into the painting. Flames erupt inside the painting.
"NO!" screams Alexandra. 
She already knows it's over for her. 
She throws her dagger in the direction of me. 
I hear a groan from behind me. Luke collapses on the floor.
"No!" I shout, "Luke!"
'Someone please helps, oh god, someone anyone." I thought.
Flames starts engulfing the page, with floor burning away in large curls.
"No, go." Luke rasps. His blood trickles onto the floor. His blood isn't golden. It's crimson red. He was a human after all. His charcoal sketch disguise crumbles. 
In replacement, I saw a young man. He had startling blue eyes and sandy hair. 
"Go now Oscar," he urged me, "There is no more time."
I run to the edge of the painting where Dad was waiting, and Beth was shouting words of encouragement to me. With tears in my eyes, I watch as flames wash over Luke. He was the hero after all. 
I heard Alexandra's screams fade away as the fire eats her in one gulp.
Just as the flames caught up to the last fraction of the canvas, I leaped off, pulling Dad with me.
We clattered on the hard creaky floor. Beth dragged us to the side as the painting shrivelled up and the blackened frame fell to the floor.
Suddenly, Mum's bedroom door opened.
She looked at us dumfounded.
"Beth, Oscar?" Mum stammered as she shook her head at Dad, "Why are you here, what's happening and why are you covered in ash and soot? W- what is this?"
I knew I was probably going to get in big trouble, but I did not care. All that mattered was that we were safe now.
</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>
It took a little explaining, but it was all sorted at the end. Dad made a deal with the person who just bought our house, and finally got that sorted.
We moved back into our old house, and we were happy. 
Beth and I had gone back to our old school, and all our old friends were glad to see us again, especially Tom, who had been a little lonely since the day I left. 
Soon, everything was back to normal. 
As we were packing up, I found a photo of me and Beth in the master bedroom. 
It was a picture of me and Beth. Even though I was still a little paranoid with paintings and photos, I decided this should be okay.
I sighed. It brought back memories of when we were little. 
Me and Beth was playing with bubbles that gleamed in the morning sunlight and bickering about who should have the bubble can. 
I still remembered that day. 
I wished life could still be as simple. 
As I got up to leave, the 5-year-old me in the photo smiled and winked back at me.
