            <span>I</span>f you ask me, salt <i class="fa-light fa-salt-shaker"></i> and pepper <i class="fa-light fa-pepper-hot"></i> do not make a good combination.
            That is why I got salt on my bedroom floor and pepper
            sprinkling in the air. Just two grinders, one salt, one pepper and that is how I started the war against salt and pepper,
            and here is how it started.

        <p> 
            It was another hot, ordinary, summer day (well I thought it was) and I was bored, so I went up the attic
            to see if there was something fun up there. Cobwebs, boxes, lamps, books, furniture, and dust, lots of dust.
            All that stood out was an old-fashioned ink pen glittering in the dim sunlight from the only window.
            The heat was overwhelming, so I took the pen, shoved it in my pocket, and climbed out.
        </p>

		<p> 
            I went in my cool, air-conditioned room and grabbed a piece of paper, and started to draw. I drew a stick pistol.
            'looks ordinary' I thought, but I was wrong. When I put the lid back on, the stick pistol changed into a miniature,
            real, metal pistol <i class="fa-light fa-gun"></i>. 
            I picked it up and lightly touched the trigger. Bang! Bang! Bang! "What are you doing in there?"
            yelled my mother, "You said you were drawing!".
            <br>
            "Nothing!" I replied quickly and hid the pistol. I wonder if... I drew my two characters I created: Billy Bob, a
            weak, little, puny salt grinder with overpowered bodyguards and Sergeant Pepperson, a powerful and undefeatable
            hero to pepper grinders. He has weak bodyguards who only held pistols. I drew each side 5 bodyguards and capped 
            the pen.
        </p>

        <p> 
            They sprang to life. The salt bodyguards reacted first, "Get away from our boss," they growled as they drew their
            weapons. The first two had riot-shields <i class="fa-light fa-shield"></i> and a tactical knife. The next one had 
            a knight stick, a flash bang and three grenades. The other had an assault rifle, a desert eagle as a secondary weapon, 
            and an emergency MP7. The last one was  shotgunner. 
            Billy Bob wore a silly grin, a thick bullet proof coat, a crown and held a bag of extra-salt chips.
            The pepper soldiers were less active, "Boss, what should we do? Shoot them?" one of the said and fired a bullet.
            It bounced off a shield man's shield.
            <br>
            "I'll deal with it", said Sergeant Pepperson, "Get away from our territory!"
            <br>
            "Your territory? Oh yeah?" challenged a salt grinder with a shield. Sergeant Pepperson held an axe 3 times sharper,
            heavier, and stronger than a lumberjack's would be. Pepperson dived at the salt grinder and swung the battle axe. It broke
            the riot shield in half.

        </p>

        <p> 
            Suddenly, the shotgunner shot a bullet that went through two pepper soldiers and making a few dents
            in Pepperson's armour. The armour consisted of give layers. Inside was a normal cloth shirt. Next was a thick tunic, leather
            pants, and leather cap followed with chainmail armour. Next was the iron chest plate, leggings and a knight helmet.
            Finally a tunic covered the rest with a cape flying behind it. St. Pepperson sliced the unguarded salt soldier in half, 
            not before having a dagger pierced through the armour, stopping just half way through the chainmail. Chaos reignited.
            Pistol bullet flew through the air and salt and pepper flew everywhere through shattered glass. Gurnades destroyed
            armour and sent the pistol flying. After minutes of fighting, all that was left was Pepperson, a dying
            shieldsman, the assault soldier, and Billy Bob. The shields man stabbed his knife into Pepperson's leggings and burst
            into salt and glass
            as the soldier took his last pistol shot, threw it away and took out his MP7. Both sides had their own worries.
            Billy Bob was worried if he finished his chips, he couldn't get more. Pepperson was worried hist armour would survive.
            He took off his destroyed chest-plate revealing the chainmail that was starting to fall apart. The salt soldier used
            the last of his bullets, destroying the chainmail and shredding the inner tunic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly, my mum called, "Come out now! It's time for lunch! I made spaghetti for you!" I put the pen down, 
            rushed out, and slammed the door. That was the beginning of my problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            I quickly dashed to the table and wolfed down my spaghetti. My mum raised her eyebrow suspiciously
            "What were you actually doing?"<br>
            "Um.. Well, uh, I was just drawing", I answered<br>
            "Well you got homework to do now", she said in an unconvincing voice.<br>
            "Well, about that, uh, I am kind of busy right now."<br>
            "Too bad! Do your homework!" she shouted<br>
            I truged to my bag and fished out my homework. Urg... The square route of 144 is 12. 8x32=256 Blah, blah, blah...
        </p>

        <p>
            After about 900 quintillion years later, I was finally done. I walked back to my room. And when I opened the door,
            oh my! it was a mess. Shattered glass scattered on the table and floor. Salt was stuck in the carpet
            and pepper were sprinkling in the air. Each team had drawn more of the pens, at least 20 on each side. The Salt
            was drawing much slower on soldiers since about half were drawing chips and banners that said: "Billy Bob's the best."
            and had a picture an iron sword <i class="fa-light fa-sword"></i> and painting to the enemy with hundreds of salt 
            soldiers rushing past him at his
            command. The pepper side had just two thirds working on soldiers and the other third on food and weapons.
            "Stop!" I said. More pepper, salt and glass fell to the floor. "I said STOP!" I yelled at the top of my lungs.
            <br>
            The shooting stopped. Pens clattered to the floor. Banners stopped waving. Then outside the room, I heard my
            mum's voice, "What? Stop what? Who are you talking to? Anyways, can you help me with the dishes, sweetheart?"
            <br>
            "Behave!" I warned the shakers. "If you continue this nonsense, I will lock you all in one little box and
            take the pens away. Clean everything up. I have to go now, my mum is calling me. You have been warned."
        </p>

        <p>
            The next two hours, I was too busy to check on the grinders. I made a mistake doing that. This time, they had swept
            away the mess but this time, they were fighting in an arena. The size covering up my bed and large desk.
            They built pillars so it would be stable. Thirty to a hundred and fifty soldiers were coming out of each side
            every round. spikes, fire barrels and mini-lava-pits were laged across the battlefield.
            <br>
            "We did what you asked," one of the salt banner holder muttered nervously, "Everything is clean."
            <br>
            "But what's with the fire and lava?" I asked furiously as I grabbed my bedside cup and splashed the water
            on the fire and lava. The fire was extinguished but the lava just cooled down a little and started turning into
            magma and rock.
            <br>
            "Umm..."
            <br>
            "Fine! I snapped," But you can only do this when I'm around.

        </p>


        <p>
            The battle continued. The salt soldiers were smashing the pepper's even though there were just 3 of them in the
            battle against thirty-seven pepper soldiers. One of them were holding two colt 1191s, the second a 
            medieval knight's sword, roman legionnaire shield and a German WW2 helmet. The third had a skull for its face and wore the
            cloth outfit for a soldier from the French Resistance. and summoned skeletons from the ground who were musketeers occasionally
            summoning French WW2 officers and some that had bayonets. The third was a necromancer. And the other team, 
            Pepperson was shooting down all the necromancer units as the weak soldiers distracted the other two salt heroes. Occassionally,
            the salt sent some of the super powerful soldiers to help the heroes. I got to admit it was pretty fun to watch,
            it was like a movie!
        </p>

        <p>
            I guess I got a liitle caught up, because when my mum called for dinner, I relised I've been watching the fight for 2 hours. 
            <br>
            "Quick, clean the mess up, and don't fight while I'm gone!"
        </p>

        <p>
            At bedtime, I didn't know what to do, I just tucked the soldiers in 2 seperate drawers so they won't fight. It was a little weird 
            sleeping with some grinders but I eventually fell asleep. About 4 hours later I woke to the sound of gunshots. 
            <br> "What are you doing?!" I exclaimed,"I thought you were making plans!"
            <br> "Yeah, we were," snarled a salt soldier as he pointed his pistol to me,"Making plans to get rid of you, we're working together."
            <br> I didn't know what to say, I was too startled to say anything, "B-But, I created you."
            <br> "We don't want to follow your stupid rules any more," growled the soldier,"Charge!"
            <br> Hundreds of soldiers came rushing at me. I swiped many away as they fell to the floor with a clatter of glass and salt or pepper.
            After a few minutes it was getting tiresome. I started to get more tired and tired and more scratches of little bullet marks appeared
            on my face. I knew more was going to come out, no matter how much blood, or as you can say salt and pepper, litter the floor, and I 
            knew soon that I would lose the fight.
        </p>

        <p>
            I wasn't going to lose so easily. I had to formulate a plan. There. I took 20 seconds to do my plan but even that I got pretty bad
            gash marks from the gurnaders. Here's my plan, I would steal one of the pens, draw myself a weapon, and then fight them. I bashed 
            into a mob of angry zombie grinders from the necromancer, and then swiped at the scribes. I knocked out about 20 of them but I only
            needed 1. I dropped the rest of the pens snatched a piece of paper, and drew a gun. I loaded it up and stared firing it which made 
            bullet holes in my table, and that probably wasn't a good sign. Finally I got to Pepperson and Billy Bob. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't really care about Billy Bob, because he was just sleeping peacefully in his fluffy bed, but Sergeant Pepperson was a 
            problem. He had his full armour and his shining axe. He placed his axe down, grabbed an assault rifle from a fallen grinder.
            He fired at me and I did back. I guess I could make giant holes in the wall, which I did, but the bullets did nothing but to 
            annoy Pepperson. Finally, my gun ran out of bullets and I threw it at him, and guess what? It just snapped in half.
        </p>

        <p>It was later I relised that I was using the wrong weapon. I quickly sketched a heavy C4 (just in case a C4 was too weak) and stuck it
            on Pepperson I held my forcefield shield out and braced for the explosion. BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP! <i>BOOOM!</i> The room exploded, 
            ashes flying everywhere as my room was torn apart. I fell to the floor, giggling in relief, well relieved until my very cranky parent
            came out.
            <br>"What's this?!" my father shouted, "You destoyed half of the house, and what's that?" he pointed to Billy Bob who was somehow
            still sleeping, "And what did you really do?! You've got some explaining to do my young lad..."
