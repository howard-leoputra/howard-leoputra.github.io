        <h1>Student Executive Speech</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>by Howard Leoputra</h2>

        <h3>Jun 2023</h3>

        <p>
            <span>G</span>ood morning teachers, staff, and fellow students. How are you? My name is Howard. 
            I am excited to be standing here as a candidate for student executive.
        </p>

        <p> 
            As a student, I believe that I can contribute ideas to make the school a better place
            of learning, growth, and friendship.
        </p>

		<p> 
            If elected, I will devote my time and work diligently to ensure that our voices are heard
            and our needs are met.
        </p>

        <p> 
            My goal is to make sure that all students feel valued and it is also important to give
            back to our community.
        </p>

        <p> 
            I am devoted to collaborate with students and teachers to create meaningful changes to enhance our school experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for considering me for this important role and again, I am looking forward to the
            opportunity to serve you all.
        </p>

        <p> 
			<span>Thank you<span>
		</p>

        <p>
